# SN20 Unity project - if you want to get your hands dirty

This project is perfect if you want to train (from scratch or from the trained model in it) an agent to land a rocket.
It may be a little messy, but I tried to my best to write clean and comprehensible code. If you have nay doubts, PM me on Twitter.

The trained model is the RocketLanding42.nn file.
