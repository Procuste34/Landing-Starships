## If you want to see rockets landing in action, you're in the right place

Make sure the AgentRocket game object (child of the Training Area game object) has the file RocketLanding42.nn for its Model.
If you have any concerns, PM on Twitter, or, look at the [docs on the Unity ML-Agents github](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/tree/master/docs), it is very complete.
